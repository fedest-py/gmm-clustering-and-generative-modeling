# gmm-clustering-and-generative-modeling
This project explores the application of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) across three machine learning tasks:

- Density Estimation with the Two-Moon Dataset

- Classification using refined GMM strategies

- Generative Modeling of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset

- It was originally completed as part of my coursework for Intro to Machine Learning (MTH 4330) at Baruch College, Spring 2024. The goal was to gain practical experience with model fitting, performance evaluation, and working with real-world datasets.

‚ú® Highlights
- Implemented unsupervised and supervised GMMs

- Used BIC and AIC to select the number of components

- Applied PCA to MNIST before modeling

- Visualized GMM means and samples for generative output

- Compared classifier performance using F1-score
